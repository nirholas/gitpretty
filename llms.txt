# Aesthetics

> Beautiful CLI tools for developers who appreciate visual polish

## Overview

Aesthetics is a collection of shell scripts that enhance your development workflow with visual elements. The primary tool is `emoji-commits.sh` which adds unique emoji commits to every file in a repository.

## Core Tools

- `emoji-commits.sh` - Add unique emoji commits to files
- `scripts/repo-stats.sh` - Repository statistics
- `scripts/git-beautify.sh` - Beautified git log
- `scripts/file-tree.sh` - Enhanced file tree
- `scripts/commit-lint.sh` - Commit linting
- `scripts/changelog-gen.sh` - Changelog generation

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nirholas/aesthetics.git
cd aesthetics
chmod +x *.sh scripts/*.sh
./emoji-commits.sh /path/to/repo
```

## Safety

All scripts use `--allow-empty` commits and SHA256 checksums to ensure zero file modifications.
